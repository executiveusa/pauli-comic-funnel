# Agents Directory

This folder will contain the individual agent personas described in the multi-agent specification (e.g., LemonAI orchestrator, Researcher, Designer, BrowserOps, DevOps, CRM).

Each subfolder should expose a `manifest.ts` (or equivalent) that registers capabilities, default toolbelts, and persona prompts for the A2A runtime. Additional documentation for each agent should live alongside its implementation.
